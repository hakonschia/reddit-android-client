## Build

The APK is built with Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1). Other versions might be incompatible.

Create the file `secrets.properties` under [/app](app) and assign the following values:

To build release versions of the application, create [signing keys](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk) and add the following values to `secrets.properties`:
```
FILE_PATH = <Path to the .jks file>
STORE_PASSWORD = <The keystore password>
KEY_ALIAS = <The alias of the key>
KEY_PASSWORD = <The key password>
```

Note: The signing values cannot be omitted. If you are not building a release version assign empty strings to these values (ie. `FILE_PATH = ""`)


Optionally, create an [Imgur app](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) and pass the client ID to make requests towards the Imgur API. Some communication is done with Imgur, but these calls are optional and the app will be functional if this is omitted. Only userless/anonymous endpoints are used.
```
IMGUR_CLIENT_ID = <The Imgur client ID>
```

### Crashlytics

The application uses [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started?platform=android) for crash reporting. Set up your Firebase projects and add the `google-services.json` file to [/app/app](/app/app). This can be omitted, but all Firebase references must be removed manually from the code (from Gradle files and [SettingsFragment](/app/app/src/main/java/com/example/hakonsreader/fragments/SettingsFragment.kt)).
